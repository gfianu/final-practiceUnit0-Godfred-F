/*
Unit 0 Project: Pathfinder - Course & Career Planner
Pseudocode:
1. Ask the user for their academic interest using readline-sync.
2. Store that input using the correct data type.
3. Define an array of major objects, each with relevant interests and careers.
4. Loop through the majors to find matches with the userâ€™s interest.
5. Use conditionals to display recommended majors and careers.
6. Test outputs using console.log.
